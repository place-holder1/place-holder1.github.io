                        <p> Formed in <b>March 2023</b> from Game Developers United, Scrap Metal Studios is a voluntary student-led team functioning as an industry-standard game development studio.  We are a hybrid studio that hosts weekly meetings and check-ups to see everyone's progress.  We communicate via Discord and in-person meetups.

                            I have created a divisive narrative structure, drafting dialogue for each main protagonist and antagonist in a desolate environment for studio members to implement their creative thought process.  These are some of the documents I've made during the beginning of the studio.

                    <h1>Dialogue System(s)</h1>
                    <p>As I'm interested in narrative designing, I am always fond of trying to create dialogue systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In Unreal Engine 5, I have made two different versions of dialogue systems: Simple & Dynamic.  A simple dialogue system involves interacting NPCs within proximity.  A dynamic dialogue system I have in mind includes having different conversations and choices every interact prompt based on stats.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dialogue-images">

                        <pre>           Simple Dialogue System                     Dynamic Dialogue System</pre>

                    <p>
                        Each conversation will have its own unique ID in the dialogue tree.  Once a choice has been made, it will then draw a reference to the conversation ID.  I designed this for Scrap Metal Studio programmers to gather reference of what they need to create.
