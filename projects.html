                    <h1>Scrap Metal Studios: Project Dyscharged</h1>
                        <p> Formed in <b>March 2023</b> from Game Developers United, Scrap Metal Studios is a voluntary student-led team functioning as an industry-standard game development studio.  
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I am currently the <b>Narrative Designer</b> for Scrap Metal Studios.  I have created a divisive narrative structure, drafting dialogue for each main protagonist and antagonist in a desolate environment.  However, I am versatile with my work as I've also worked on providing resources to my team and filling roles whenever necessary.  One of my examples include reinventing a battle theme our music producer prototyped, providing a blueprint to finalizing the battle theme.

                    <p>Creating raster and vector illustrations through computer programs such as P5.js and Adobe, I delved deep into color theory, perception, and image manipulation.

                    One of my best works in this class is a recreation of the Sydney Lego set.  It was a very intensive project for me as I manually drew nearly every single line and reshade on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                        For my <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/carlcarl/sketches/BsHo6Kw4H"><b>final project</b></a>, I worked with Aaron White to create a data visualization of measurements of the human body.  I was the programmer and debugger for this project.  The only known issue with the code is the dropdown positioning due to p5.js and JavaScript conflicting with each other.  However, the professor was impressed at the complexity so he let it slide.  The project is better viewed on the actual site.
