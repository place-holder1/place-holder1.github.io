                    <h1>Scrap Metal Studios: Project Dyscharged</h1>
                        <p> Formed in <b>March 2023</b> from Game Developers United, Scrap Metal Studios is a voluntary student-led team functioning as an industry-standard game development studio.

                            <br>
                            I am currently the <b>narrative designer</b> for Scrap Metal Studios.  I have created a divisive narrative structure, drafting dialogue for each main protagonist and antagonist in a desolate environment.  However, I am versatile with my work as I've also worked on providing resources to my team and filling roles whenever necessary.  One of my examples include reinventing a battle theme our music producer prototyped, providing a blueprint to finalizing the battle theme.

                        For my <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/carlcarl/sketches/BsHo6Kw4H"><b>final project</b></a>, I worked with Aaron White to create a data visualization of measurements of the human body.  I was the programmer and debugger for this project.  The only known issue with the code is the dropdown positioning due to p5.js and JavaScript conflicting with each other.  However, the professor was impressed at the complexity so he let it slide.  The project is better viewed on the actual site.
