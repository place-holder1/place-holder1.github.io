                    <h1>Music Production</h1>

                    <p>Captivated by a wide variety of musical genres, I am driven to pursue music production as both a passion and a hobby.  Over the years, I have been on and off with production; however, my enthusiasm remains whether I'm actively producing or not.  I am actively exploring melodic structures in different genres through experimentation to create my own unique flavor.  My breakout goal would be to produce music for festivals such as Tomorrowland or have a viral sensation in Spotify.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I first started my journey with LMMS, a free DAW comparable to FL Studio back in 2018.  I learned a lot from the fundamentals of producing music to mixing and mastering every single instrument.  In December 2023, I acquired FL Studio to elevate my skills in music production.  What I will be showcasing is a mix of my musical experiments and projects throughout the years.

                            A remix of the battle theme for Scrap Metal Studio's Project: Dyscharged, paving a blueprint to finalizing the battle theme.

                              <p>A boss theme with minimal movement in the main melody and a good amount of ear candy.  The bridge of the song is the "spiciest" section which I'm proud of.  One of my friends even remixed my song to a psytrance version!

                                  <p>This is a project I've worked on the most in terms of mixing.  There's so much equalizing, compression, and automation that my old laptop nearly couldn't handle it!  This was made during the start of my production era, so I plan on remixing and modernizing it in FL Studio.
