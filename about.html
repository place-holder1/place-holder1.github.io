                    <p>I am a Game Development & Web Development double major with a English & Creative Writing double minor.  My skills include C++, C# HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, Music Production, and Creative Writing. </p>
                    <p>
                        As a young child, I delved into the world of web-based games on PC, exploring diverse genres from single-player adventures like the Papa's series to immersive online games by Goodgame Studios.  This early fascination sparked a lifelong curiosity. Later, I enjoyed memorable experiences on the Wii, indulging in lively games such as Wii Sports Resort and PokePark 2: Wonders Beyond.  At 13, I acquired an Xbox One, where I dedicated myself to crafting intricate worlds and puzzles in Minecraft, inviting others to join and explore.  Just a few years ago, I moved back to PC, but instead I delved into franchise games such as Metal Gear Solid V and Epic Battle Fantasy 5.</p>

                    <p>I play a wide variety of genres.  Some of them are, but not limited to:
                        <ul>Tycoon Management</ul>
                        <ul>Strategy</ul>
                        <ul>Simulation</ul>
                        <ul>Sports</ul>
                        <ul>Role Playing</ul>
                        <ul>Sandbox</ul>
                        <ul>Puzzles</ul>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p> I'm currently in a student-lead studio called <b>Scrap Metal Studios</b> as a narrative designer and one of the founding members.  Formed in March 2023, we are a Purdue Univesity-based student-led studio working on a 2.5D pixel art Unreal Engine game.  Our project, Project: Dyscharged, is a voluntary passion project for all of us as we focus primarily on our coursework.  We host weekly meetings and strong comfort vibes as the team develops the game on the side with strong chemistry.</p>

                    <p>I am still enthusiastically seeking opportunities to expand knowledge and skills through continuous learning and professional development initiatives.  I only plan to fail forward in order to reach my dreams.</p>

                    <p>
                        In my free time, I think of many ways to hone my craft.  Whether it be music production, designing narratives, or programming, I am always turning my gears and create fresh projects.
