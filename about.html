                    <p>When I a very young child, I was first exposed to the world of web-based games with a wide variety of genres.  From playing single-player games like the Papa's series to online-web based games created by Goodgame Studios, these early experiences fueled the start of an era for my curiosity.  Years later, I managed to pick up the Wii, and I had an extravagent time playing party-based games and being immersed with my favorites Wii Sports Resort and PokePark 2: Wonders Beyond.  At the age of 13, I acquired the Xbox One to play Minecraft, and I had spent years crafting and designing worlds and puzzles for other players to join and test out.</p>

                    <p>I play a wide variety of genres.  Some of them are, but not limited to:
                        <ul>Tycoon Management</ul>
                        <ul>Strategy</ul>
                        <ul>Simulation</ul>
                        <ul>Sports</ul>
                        <ul>Role Playing</ul>
                        <ul>Sandbox</ul>
